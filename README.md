## 🛠️ Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit the CSS variables in `src/index.css` to change the color scheme:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 221 83% 53%;
  --accent: 176 68% 64%;
  /* other colors... */
}
```

### Portfolio & Blogs (Google Sheets CMS)

Portfolio and Blogs are managed in a **public Google Spreadsheet** — no code changes or redeploys needed when content updates.

1. Create one spreadsheet with tabs named **`Portfolio`** and **`Blogs`**
2. Add header rows with these exact column names:

   **Portfolio:** `Title`, `Description`, `ImageURL`, `DriveLink`, `DisplayOrder`, `Visible`

   **Blogs:** `Title`, `Description`, `ImageURL`, `LinkedInURL`, `DisplayOrder`, `Visible`

3. Share the spreadsheet: **Anyone with the link → Viewer**
4. Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL and add it to `.env`:

   ```sh
   VITE_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id_here
   ```

5. For images, paste a standard Google Drive sharing link into `ImageURL`. The site converts it automatically for display. Ensure each image file is also shared as **Anyone with the link can view**.

Set `Visible` to `TRUE` to show a row, `FALSE` to hide it. Use `DisplayOrder` to control sort order (lower numbers appear first).

### Adding New Sections

1. Create a new component in `/src/sections/`
2. Add the corresponding data in `/src/data/profile.ts`
3. Import and add the component to `App.tsx`
